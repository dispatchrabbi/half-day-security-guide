# The Half-Day Security Guide

Got half a day and nothing to do? Level up your electronic privacy!

This is the code that powers the guide. Looking for the actual guide? Go to (LINK TBD).

## Structure

There are several directories in this project, each for a different aspect of it:
- _lib/_ contains the code that does the site generation
- _layout/_ contains the HTML, CSS, and JS for the structure of the site
- _src/_ contains the actual text for the guide
- _dist/_ is where the output goes, so that's the directory that should get served
